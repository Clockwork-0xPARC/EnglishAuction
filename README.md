# Rules
The rules of the word game played between bot programs are as follows:

- The game is played by bots that are written by programmers.
- Bots can join a match room with a maximum of 5 participants.
- The game starts with a hidden bag of 100 scrabble letters.
- Each bot is secretly given 5 letters from the bag.
- Each bot is given 100 points to start.
- The remaining scrabble letters are auctioned off to the bots in a first price, sealed bid auction.
- Every second, a random letter is chosen from the bag and shown to all participants.
- All bots are assumed to bid 0 for the letter at the start of the second.
- During the 1-second auction period, the bots can change their current bid for the letter.
- At the end of the 1-second period, the highest bidder is chosen and awarded the letter.
- In case of a tie, the earlier bidder wins.
- All participants can see the ID of the winning bidder.
- This process continues until all the letters have been auctioned off.
- At any time during the auction, a bot can submit a word that they can create using their letters. The word will be secretly scored according to the scrabble letter point rules, with a bonus of 10 points for words that are 9 letters long.
- Once all the letters have been auctioned off, the bots have 1 additional second to submit their words for scoring.
- All bots are ranked by the number of points they have scored.
- A tournament consists of 10 matches, and the winner is the player who has scored the most points in total across all matches.
